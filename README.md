# Talk to Links ðŸ’¬
Talk to as many links as you want. Get a summary, ask specific questions, explore the depths of the information. Your imagination is the limit.

## Why?
- Too many websites of your interest to read? 
- Too many news to follow? 
- Too many Medium posts saved and not enough time to read them all?
